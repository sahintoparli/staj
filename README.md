A student management system (software) project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based Python script and executable that allows the administrator to enter student data into a database and export the data to a CSV file. In this project, I utilised Tkinter for the graphical user interface, PyMySQL for database and query creation, PIL for picture loading, Pandas to convert the data to a CSV file, time to define the time, and date and as well as ttkthemes for the button themes.


## Requirements For `.py` File
* Tkinter
* PIL
* TTKthemes
* PyMySQL
* Pandas
* Time
* MySQL


## Requirements For `.exe` File

* MySQL


## Installation

* Download `.exe` file from the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/wyd-18/Student-Management-System/releases/latest)
```bash
  Just run the System Management System.exe file
```

* Download `.zip` file from the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/wyd-18/Student-Management-System/releases/latest)
```bash
  Extract and run the System Management System.exe file
```


## Note

* MySQL is needed to run the Python script and executable file.

* Set up a connection on MySQL before running it.

* Simply clone the repo and run the "main.py" file, and for executables, download from releases and run the .exe file.

* For connecting databases, the host name, username, and password are the same as for a MySQL connection.

* For logging in, Username - `admin` and Password - `admin@123`
